Question 1

1. Which method in which class runs a game? (the answer is not run, because run is not a method)!
- a method called simulate in the AntColony class.

2. The Hive, a subclass of Place, is the starting location of the bees. Unlike most instances of Place, the Hive class does not have an exit. Explain how and when Bees leave the Hive.
- With in different AssaultPlan the bees leave the Hive in timely manner.

3. Explain the mechanism in the code by which the places in the colony are laid out. How do you modify the code to produce more places?
- The size of the grid is defined by parameters to the mix_layout function

4. What is the significance of an Insect's armor attribute? What happens when armor reaches 0?
- armor is a value representing how strong the ant is. The ant vanish if its armor reaches zero.
once at 0, remove_insect

5. Both Ants and Bees inherit from the Insect class. What does this mean? What similarities and differences are there between Ants and Bees?
- Ants and Bees are both Insect objects and have intrinsic definition of armor and place. Also both can perform the mothod of reduce_armor and actions. Bees have more mothods defined in its class, whereas Ants is a more general class and ants for different actions were defined seperately.

6. Locate the Ant class. Identify an Ant's class attributes and instance attributes. What is the difference between the two?
- class attribute: implemented, damage, food_cost; any change of these attributes will change the status of future Ant objects. Instance attributes: armor, the armor of one one is independent of the others.
